Computers are tools, for solving problems with better solutions

they are "thinking machines" that:

1. Input
    1. Phones, mic, keyboard, mouse, etc.
    1. converted to binary information
1. Store
    1. Memory
    1. Uses
    1. on / off -bit
    1. binary
        1. 0,1
        1. Positions
        1. text - each letter is a number
        1. images - pixel from binary system
        1. sound - more bit = higher range
1. Process
    1. algorithms
    1. circuits - on / off
    1. NOT - 1=0, 0=1
    1. AND - 1+0 = 1
    1. ADDER - adds together for sum
    1. all operations are 1/0 adding.
    1. smaller circuit = faster electronic travel
1. Output
    1. convert binary into physical output
    1. speaker - play sound
    1. CNC
    1. robots' movement

Originally made of wood and metal - VERY large.

Modern computers have multiple CPUs.

__Hardware__ - what you see

- CPU controls everything, from receiving simple commands
- follows order of math operations

__Software__ - command conversion, many languages - tells the CPU what to do

- Operating System (OS) - program with special abilities
  - helps share CPU between softwares

### Example

1. push letter "B"
1. cpu calculates, draws from memory
1. converted to what is seen
(one letter is thousands of instructions)

## Electricity

## Code
