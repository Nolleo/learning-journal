# **Growth Mindset**
> To me, Growth Mindset is the powerful reminder that the potential of anything is within my power to learn.  When growth is the goal, everything is a Win or Lesson, an opportunity to gain.  Opposing growth is a Fixed Mindset, leaving movement. 

Fixed Mindset | When faced with... | Growth Mindset | Reminders
------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ---------
Avoids | CHALLENGES | Embraces | Take a step back, look at the clues.
Loses focus | OBSITCALES | Persists | walk away and return with more inspiration
Views as fruitless | EFFORT | No pain, no gain | Ask myself, what is it that I really want?
Ignores | CRITICISM | Learns from | What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?
Views as threat | SUCCESS OF OTHERS | Is inspired by | see peers with skills that complement mine
~~*Fails to reach full potential*~~ | OUTCOME | **Achieves more & Higher goals** | I want to achieve!
