# Text Editors, Because Easy > Hard

### Coding is a LOT of small parts to make up one big part.  Colors, organization and tools make those small parts easy(er).

__text editor:__ _a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text_

With the many text editors available, here are a few important features

Feature | Value 
------- | -----
code completion | faster creation and less errors
syntax highlighting | overall ease of code view and parts of code
variety of themes | reduce eye strain & fatigue
extensions | Many options for particular needs or applications, making coding more simple for complex _and repeated_ tasks. :point_up: this is a feature deserving of some personal exploration.

__Emmett__ is shorthand, completing common code phrases automatically.

__Syntax highlighting__ color codes the code, much easier to to spot code errors and patterns. 

A __*dark__ theme* for background creates more contrast to see word colors while making the overall light from a screen lower.  This saves the coder's eyes :grimacing face: and reduces computer power consumption :deciduous tree:.
