I am Noel Davenport!  

My first effrorts in building a big robust website was when launching my business that required complex credit card rules and ID checking process.  I eventually made something that met the WA LCB requirements, but finally hired a company to improve and maintain.  If I had more code abilities I would have save a TON of money, and maintained more creative control.  Please see this image of me and my business partner from the 2009 days of iHaveMunchies ("IHM") - home delivery of alcohol, tobaco and munchies!
