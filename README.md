# learning-journal
Hi, my name is Noel Davenport!  And my first effrorts in building a big robust website was when I launched a business that required complex credit card rules and ID checking process.  I eventually made something that met the WA LCB requirements, but finally hired a company to improve and maintain.  If I had more code abilities I would have save a TON of money, and maintained more creative control.  Please see this image of me and my business partner from the 2009 days of iHaveMunchies ("IHM") - home delivery of alcohol, tobaco and munchies!

My current endevor is also delivery, focused on micro-batch ice cream Flying Pengwyn Ice Cream - www.flyingpengwyn.com (I appreciate ideas and feedback)
You can see my GitHub portfolio https://github.com/Nolleo (please feel free to browse and star)

This is a place where I can learn or take notes.

These notes will help me formalize my coding language, learning from the ground up.  These building blocks will help me expand professionally, and help my ice cream business:
1. Empower my general website abilities 
1. Improve the flying pengwyn :airplane: :penguin: business
	1. More friendly
	1. More features 
	
# **Growth Mindset**
> To me, Growth Mindset is the powerful reminder that the potential of anything is within my power to learn.  When growth is the goal, everything is a Win or Lesson, an opportunity to gain.  Opposing growth is a Fixed Mindset, leaving movement  

Fixed Mindset | When faced with... | Growth Mindset | Reminders
------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ---------
Avoids | CHALLENGES | Embraces | Take a step back, look at the clues.
Loses focus | OBSITCALES | Persists | walk away and return with more inspiration
Views as fruitless | EFFORT | No pain, no gain | Ask myself, what is it that I really want?
Ignores | CRITICISM | Learns from | What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?
Views as threat | SUCCESS OF OTHERS | Is inspired by | see peers with skills that complement mine
~~*Fails to reach full potential*~~ | OUTCOME | **Achieves more & Higher goals** | I want to achieve!
