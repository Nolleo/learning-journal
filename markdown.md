# _Notes on Markdown with explinations for non-technical readers_

Markdown is a way to style text on the web.  
> This makes simple notation virtually universal and easy

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.
> Since GitHub is used by many different for many different uses, the universal 

## A few examples:

QUOTING CODE
Use backticks to get this effect of code

```
quoted code 1
quoted code 2
```
> This is a great tool to show the raw code _(vs how the code will impact visually)_ __We'll use this as notes below the examples__

**bold** or __
*italic* or _

```
**bold** or __
*italic* or _
```

> Helpful visualizations to draw attention and focus to certain words or phrases.

```

> Helpful to share links within or to outside webpages.

# <h1> tag
### <h3> tag

```
# <h1> tag
### <h3> tag
```

> The "h tags" range h1 through h6, and very helpful to direct sections with hierarchy. 

### LISTS
> Below are examples of various Lists.  Depending on application or need, some Lists are structured only by layers _(Nests)_ while others have particualr orders _(Ordered)_.
Unordered

#### UNORDERED

* Item 1
	* Item 1a
	* Item 1b
* Item 2

```
* Item 1
	*Item 1a
	*Item 1b
* Item 2
```

#### ORDERED

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
	1. Item 2a
	1. Item 2b

```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
	1. Item 2a
	1. Item 2b
```

#### NESTED

1. Fisrt list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

```
1. Fisrt list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
```

#### Tasks

> This is a very specific type of visual communication, denoting what has been done and to be done.
- [x] completed
- [ ] to do 1
- [ ] to do 2

```
- [x] completed
- [ ] to do 1
- [ ] to do 2

## BLOCKQUOTES
> This is what we're using to make notes about the tags and how they are helpful :+1:

As Ja-Z said:

> Life is for livin'
> Not livin' uptight.

## STRIKETHROGH
> This is good use of showing what's been removed or needs to be removed _(very helpful to show sale prices that have been reduced from ~~REGULAR PRICE~~)_

## TABLES
> __One of my faves!__ Since this simple tag has the ability to illustrate so much information in a friendly way, I give it TWO :+1: :+1:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

> And last but not least, another of my faves _*EMOJIS*_. With a picture being worth 1,000 words and essentially a universal language, it's something I look forward to growing my coding ability to use more fluently! See [Wikipedia's Emoji list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) to explore.

##### And it's THAT EASY to add tags for more clear communication in a very simple platform.  ~~WHATEVER~~ __THANKS__
